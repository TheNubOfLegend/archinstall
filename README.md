# Arch Install Script so I don't forget that one config variable I set before ritualistically eviscerating my OS

This is a bash based Arch Linux installation script with EFI boot loader and ext4 partition prepared for me.

This script is not meant to be customizable, but it may be useful to others as a starting point

Don't expect the code to be particularly good. This is my first experience with Bash scripting, and the end result is mostly just a cobbled-together Frankenstein's monster of these two projects: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ArchTitus and https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/archinstall

As usual: I take no responsibility for what may happen to your computer as a result of using my script. If you do something you shouldn't, figure out how to fix it yourself. You're installing Arch. The whole point is that you should know or have the drive to figure out what your issue is.
